# Resume-Retriever
AI-powered microservice that retrieves, ranks, and selects the most relevant resumes based on a given job query using semantic search and LLM-based reranking.


### âœ… Step 1: Set Up Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

#### ðŸ”¹ For Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### ðŸ”¹ For macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### âœ… Step 2: Install Requirements

Make sure you're in the project root directory (where `requirements.txt` is located), then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### âœ… Step 3: Embed Resumes and Create Vector Store

Once dependencies are installed, run the following script to:

* Load resume files (PDF or TXT) from `data/resumes`
* Convert them into LangChain-compatible documents
* Generate embeddings using a transformer model
* Store those embeddings in a persistent local vector store

#### ðŸ”¹ Command:

```bash
python resume_matcher/scripts/embed_resumes.py
```

Make sure your resume files are placed in the following folder structure:

```
resume_matcher/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ resumes/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ resume1.pdf
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ resume2.txt
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ...
```

> âœ… This step will create a persistent vector store under the `data/vectorstore/` folder.

Let me know if you also want to include instructions for running a search, deleting the vector store, or preventing duplicates.
